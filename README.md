## Introduction
Data structures are essential components in computer science that allow efficient organization, storage, and retrieval of data. This readme aims to provide a  description to various data structures, c

## Stacks
- Stacks follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed.

## Queues
- Queues follow the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first one to be removed.

## Trees
- Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root node and branches, often used for representing hierarchical relationships.

## Graphs
- Graphs consist of vertices (nodes) and edges connecting them. They represent relationships between various entities.

## Hash Tables
- Hash Tables use a hash function to map keys to indices, providing efficient key-value pair storage and retrieval.
